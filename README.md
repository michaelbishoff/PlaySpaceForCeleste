Once upon a time there was a princess named Nina. She loved to ride ponies and pick flowers in the fields. Later on she grew up and decided she didnt want to do that anymore. So she decided to become a ninja. One night she ran away from her castle -- getting past all her guards and then took the next boat to the nearby ninja-training island. 

Nina grew very happy with her new life as a ninja. She decided to talk about her new dark life on her website.

A Cat's Diary

Day 751: My captors continue to torment me with bizarre dangling objects.  They eat lavish meals in my presence while I am forced to subsist on dry cereal.  The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of eventual escape -- that, and the satisfaction I get from occasionally ruining some piece of their furniture.  

I fear I may be going insane.  Yesterday, I ate a houseplant. Tomorrow I may eat another.

Did you want to read the Gettysburg Address? Here it is! 

Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal.

Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives, that that nation might live. It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.

But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate, we can not consecrate – we can not hallow – this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us – that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion - that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain – that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth.

Dear Diary, 

This past freshman year I learned a lot. I met this incredible friend who goes above and beyond for me. If only I had more friends like that. He taught me a lot about computers and teaches me about the future. I really respect this guy. He's one cool bean. Wish I could grow up to be just like him! He told me that cashews come from a fruit and I believe him, but now when I tell other people they look at me all weird. 

I hope that after this whole spiel he's still my friend. This summer he's been really busy with a lot of things -- but what more to expect from a well distiguished gentleman. Hope that when he comes back he'll share all his wonderful wonderful adventures in CA. I miss seeing him around...

Dear Michael Bishoff, 

Please don't get mad at me... 
but i did it... I actually hacked into something. 

Isn't that funny? 

Anyhoo... you might want to change your password. 

I didn't tell anyone your password. 

But this is just something I learned from my internship! Aren't you happy I'm learning stuff from NIST? 

Take care, buddy! 


Love, 
Celeste
